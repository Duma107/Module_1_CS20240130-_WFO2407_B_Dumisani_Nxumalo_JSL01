### Overview

The **Pet Adoption Syntax Validator** is a web-based tool developed to assist SPCA volunteers in ensuring that pet adoption codes follow the required format. The validator checks if the codes start with "pet_" followed by the pet's birth year and name, providing instant feedback to users on whether the entered code is valid or invalid.

### Code Structure

#### 1. HTML Structure

The HTML document is organized with a well-defined structure, including a head section that links to the CSS and JavaScript files and a body section containing the main content. Semantic elements such as headers, paragraphs, and divs are used appropriately to enhance readability and maintainability. The input fields and buttons are positioned to create an intuitive user experience.

#### 2. CSS Styling

The CSS file applies consistent styling across the webpage, focusing on a clean and modern design. The font family is chosen for readability, and a calming color scheme is used to create a welcoming user interface. Buttons and input fields are styled with subtle effects to improve interactivity. The validation result and status indicator are aligned under the input field for a clear and concise presentation.

#### 3. JavaScript Logic

JavaScript is used to implement the validation logic for the pet adoption codes. The code is structured to be easy to understand, with clear variable naming and consistent commenting to explain the logic. A regular expression is used to validate the syntax, ensuring that the input matches the required format. The feedback mechanism updates the validation result and status indicator based on the input's validity, with clear visual cues provided to the user.
